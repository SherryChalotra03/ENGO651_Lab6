## Overview
This project is a web-based application that demonstrates line simplification using Leaflet.js and Turf.js. Users can draw a polyline on an interactive map by clicking on the map, and after adding at least 5 points, they can simplify the polyline using a "Simplify Polyline" button. The original polyline is displayed in blue, and the simplified polyline is shown in red. A summary of the number of points before and after simplification is displayed at the bottom of the page.
